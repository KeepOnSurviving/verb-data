Possibly derived from arar (\u201cto plough\u201d), from Latin ar\u0101re, with the sense taken from that of making shallow furrows or grooves. Alternatively, linked to ara\u00f1a (\u201cspider\u201d) from Latin ar\u0101nea, though a semantic link is difficult; perhaps the meaning stemmed from the spider being an aggressive animal, to that of fighting or quarreling, and later a secondary sense of \"scratch\" developed as a result (compare Old French hargner (\u201cto fight\u201d) and modern French hargneux (\u201caggressive\u201d), which may be of Germanic origin instead; see also old Italian aragnarsi (\u201ccome to blows\u201d)). It may instead have a link to the meaning developed in Romanian r\u00e2ie (\u201cscabies, mange, itch\u201d), which itself was derived from the same Latin word, ar\u0101nea (cf. also Spanish ro\u00f1a and Italian rogna (\u201cscabies, mange\u201d), which may come from a variant form *aronea; compare aru\u00f1ar, the alternative form of ara\u00f1ar, which may alternatively have been influenced by u\u00f1a (\u201cnail\u201d)). In this theory, the original meaning was to scrape or scratch oneself to relieve an itch, but this has not been attested. It is possible the relation with ar\u0101nea is more indirect, however.[1]", "page_id": 637737, "pronunciations": [], "related": ["ara\u00f1azo", "ara\u00f1a", "rasgu\u00f1ar", "rasgu\u00f1o", "raju\u00f1ar", "rascar"], "synonyms": [], "url": "https://en.wiktionary.org/?curid=637737#Spanish", "word": "ara\u00f1ar"}
